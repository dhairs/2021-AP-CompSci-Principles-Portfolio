// Description: A choose your own game/adventure. You pick a game from a list, and are prompted to make
// it through a list of "situations," if you get the answers right, you continue, otherwise the game ends
// with the current score.

// Import the Readline module, built into Node.js 
import * as readline from 'readline';


// Game essentials setup -- using this to setup the readline module and allow for user input in the terminal

// TERMINAL SETUP ------------------------------
const rlInterface = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
});

// functional component for the program, isn't meant to run games, but is meant to allow inputs from users
var situationQuestion = function (question): Promise < string > {
